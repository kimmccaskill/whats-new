# What's New - News Application

## Solo project by Kim McCaskill during Module 3 at Turing School of Software and Design

### Learning Goals:

- Create my first application that uses React framework
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Create a robust test suite through Jest and Enzyme that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### Overview of Site:
- This application is a news application that displays news articles received from an API
- The user has ability to filter news articles by category or using the search bar to find articles containing a specific word
- The site can be tested for accessibility via Chrome Dev tools running accessibility audits.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS/Sass
- Javascript/jQuery
- Mocha/Chai
- git

## Setup

Fork then clone down this repository. 

Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text and a pink background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.


## How to View Your Code in Action

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:

```bash
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view code running in the browser.

## Running Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.
